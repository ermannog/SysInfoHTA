# SysInfoHTA
System Information HTML Application

System Information HTML Application is an hta file that scan a system to retreive information about Hardware, OS and System components.

For start SysInfo.hta in possible use the batch script SysInfoHTA.cmd, this script can be used to launch the hta file on 64-bit operating systems (so that the correct parser is used). For more info see the post [Sistemi operativi a 64 e HTA](https://www.devadmin.it/2011/09/07/sistemi-operativi-a-64-e-hta/) on my [blog](https://www.devadmin.it/).
